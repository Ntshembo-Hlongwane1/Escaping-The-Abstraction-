# Project 1 - Search Engine

## Objective

Build a search engine from first principles.

The goal is not to build a Google competitor.

The goal is to deeply understand:

* Information Retrieval
* Index Structures
* Search Architectures
* Data Structures
* Text Processing
* Ranking Systems
* Concurrency
* Storage Design

By the end of this project you should understand how a search engine transforms raw documents into searchable information.

# Project Structure

This project will be built in multiple versions.

Each version introduces a new problem.

Each problem naturally introduces a new data structure or algorithm.

Do not skip versions.

---

# Version 1 - Basic Document Search

## Goal

Build the smallest possible search engine.

No ranking.

No trie.

No fuzzy search.

Just search.

---

## Features

* Read text files
* Store documents
* Search for exact words
* Return matching documents

---

## Example Documents

redis.txt

```text
Redis is an in-memory database.
Redis supports caching.
```

kafka.txt

```text
Kafka is an event streaming platform.
```

golang.txt

```text
Go supports concurrency through goroutines.
```

---

## User Input

```bash
search redis
```

---

## Output

```text
Found 1 document

redis.txt
```

---

## Example 2

Input

```bash
search kafka
```

Output

```text
Found 1 document

kafka.txt
```

---

## Example 3

Input

```bash
search concurrency
```

Output

```text
Found 1 document

golang.txt
```

---

## Data Structures

Use:

* Array
* HashMap

---

## What You Learn

* File IO
* String Processing
* Basic Search
* Hashing

---

# Version 2 - Tokenization & Normalization

## Problem

These should all mean the same thing:

```text
Redis
redis
REDIS
```

But Version 1 treats them differently.

---

## Goal

Normalize documents before indexing.

---

## Features

* Lowercase conversion
* Remove punctuation
* Basic tokenization

---

## Example

Document

```text
Redis, Redis! REDIS.
```

Stored As

```text
redis
redis
redis
```

---

## Input

```bash
search redis
```

---

## Output

```text
redis.txt
```

---

## Example 2

Input

```bash
search Redis
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
```

---

## Example 3

Input

```bash
search REDIS
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
```

---

## Data Structures

* HashMap
* Arrays

---

## What You Learn

* Text normalization
* Tokenization
* Parsing pipelines

---

# Version 3 - Stop Word Removal

## Problem

Words like:

```text
the
and
is
of
a
```

appear in almost every document.

They pollute the index.

---

## Goal

Remove low value words.

---

## Example

Document

```text
Redis is a database.
```

Indexed As

```text
redis
database
```

---

## Input

```bash
search is
```

Output

```text
No Results
```

---

## Input

```bash
search database
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
```

---

## What You Learn

* Search optimization
* Index reduction

---

# Version 4 - Inverted Index

## Problem

Current search scans documents.

This becomes slow.

---

## Goal

Build an inverted index.

Instead of:

```text
Document -> Words
```

Store:

```text
Word -> Documents
```

---

## Example Index

```text
redis

    redis.txt
    cache.txt

database

    redis.txt
    postgres.txt
```

---

## Input

```bash
search database
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
postgres.txt
```

---

## Input

```bash
search redis
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
cache.txt
```

---

## What You Learn

* Inverted Indexes
* Information Retrieval
* Search Architecture

---

## Data Structures

* HashMap

Critical milestone.

This is the heart of every search engine.

---

# Version 5 - Multi-Term Search

## Goal

Search more than one word.

---

## Input

```bash
search distributed systems
```

---

## Output

```text
raft.txt
kafka.txt
```

---

## Example 2

Input

```bash
search redis cache
```

Output

```text
redis.txt
redis-cluster.txt
```

---

## Example 3

Input

```bash
search golang concurrency
```

Output

```text
golang.txt
```

---
